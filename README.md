# DeepNeuralWorks

## Overview
Welcome to DeepNeuralWorks! This repository contains implementations of deep learning models for predictive analysis, focusing on concepts of deep learning like ANN,CNN,RNN and AutoEncoders.

## Models Implemented

- Iris Dataset Classification: Classifying iris flowers into species based on measurements.
- Breast Cancer Prediction: Predicting breast cancer using diagnostic image features.
- Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction: Identifying customers who are likely to leave in the near future.

## Datasets Used
- Iris Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

## Usage
- Each model has its own directory with detailed instructions:

- breast_cancer_prediction: Predict breast cancer.
- iris_classification: Classify iris flowers.
- Bank Customer Churn prediction dataset

## Contributing

- Contributions are welcome! Fork the repo and submit a pull request.
